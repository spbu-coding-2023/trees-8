# Binary Trees Project

Team #8's project on binary trees.

## About

Three trees are implemented in this library: [R&B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redâ€“black_tree), [AVL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) and [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree).

## Authors

- [Aleksey Dmitrievtsev](https://github.com/admitrievtsev) - Red&Black Tree
- [Gleb Nasretdinov](https://github.com/Ycyken) - AVL Tree
- [Azamat Ishbaev](https://github.com/odiumuniverse) - Binary Search Tree

## Technologies

- Kotlin 1.9.22
- JDK 17
- [Gradle 8.6](https://gradle.org)

## Library information

Three trees are implemented, choose which one you want.
Standard methods are implemented in each tree:

+ `insert()` - Inserting a tree node by key and value
+ `remove()` - Deleting a tree node by key
+ `find()` -  Searching by key
+ `traverse()` - Traversing the tree depending on the selected path search

AVL and R&B trees are self-balancing
